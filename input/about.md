My name is Michael Burch. I [write code](https://github.com/michaelburch) and [encourage companies to adopt cloud computing](https://linkedin.com/in/michaelpburch). I work out of my home office, currently in Duncan, Oklahoma although that seems to change about every year or so. This kind of work leads to a sedentary lifestyle, so to offset the negative effects of that I also [run](https://www.strava.com/athletes/20297841), [hike](https://www.alltrails.com/members/michael-burch-9) and generally make an effort to be more active.

I started this blog to write about things that interest me - cloud computing, code, running, technology, gadgets, hiking, and open source. As such, 
**all content and opinions here are my own and do not represent my employer's view in any way.**

I don't feel compelled to particpate in social media, and when it comes to Facebook I consider myself a [conscientious objector](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/05/facebook-conscientious-objectors/327694/). So while you won't find me there, I would enjoy hearing from you either through the comments on this blog or via an e-mail to [me@michaelburch.net](mailto:me@michaelburch.net?subject=%20hello%20from%20michaelburch.net) 



Background
============

I've worked in technology since 1999, when I left college (and a warehouse job) to work in semiconductor manufacturing at IBM. I've been blessed that my lack of education hasn't limited my employent options very much, and I've worked for some really amazing companies from [start-ups](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin), to government contractors and [large enterprises](https://www.halliburton.com), a really unique [R&D facility](https://www.ll.mit.edu/),  and my personal favorite [The Vermont Country Store](https://www.vermontcountrystore.com/). I currently work for a managed services company, promoting and enabling cloud and PaaS transformation.

I've thoroughly enjoyed learning throughout every step of my career, seeing how the chips that power computers are made, deploying large scale systems across the country and connecting remote regions with satellite uplinks in [austere conditions](images/austere.jpg) ,writing code in Python, C# (and other .NET languages), and automating deployments in the AWS and Azure clouds. When you've been the person responsible for building servers, racking, stacking, connecting and configuring them - automated cloud deploys can give you the same feeling you get when [a new Apple product is released](https://theoatmeal.com/comics/apple), and you'll never want to go back.

More
===

I was so captivated by the text-input graphic adventure game [Space Quest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Quest_I), that I learned to spell at an early age just to complete the game. My first coding experience was in BASIC, where I attempted to write a game that would become more popular than [Test Drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Drive_(1987_video_game)). While my ambition out-paced my skill and the capabilities of my computer it also sparked a passion for technology that has enabled me to live a comfortable life with minimal formal education. 

I've lived in Oklahoma, Texas, New York, Vermont, Massachusetts, and Afghanistan to name just a few places. I have a loving wife and wonderful children, enjoy studying the Bible and spending time with my church family,  and am motivated by anything that enables me to learn something new. I love being around other people who have a positive attitude. 

As with anyone else, there's much more about me than you can know by reading a few paragraphs, like my political or religious affiliation, but in keeping with the [single responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) this blog will be limited to only those things that are releated to technology.
