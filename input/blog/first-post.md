This is my first post! I started this blog to write about things that interest me - apologetics, cloud computing, code, running, technology, gadgets, hiking, open source, and whatever else happens to interest me. 

My first real inspiration for creating a blog came from [this excellent site](https://keysleft.com/). Realizing that I have a finite number of keystrokes left in my hands (as we all do), and that I am acutally more likely to delete an e-mail than write a response that duplicates something I have written before led me to the conclusion that I should blog instead. 

I may not have anything interesting to write, but I won't write it twice and at the very least I can make better use of my 235,007,984 remaining (as of this writing) keystrokes.
