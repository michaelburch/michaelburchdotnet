Microsoft introduced Azure Container Apps, in 2022 as an easier way to deploy apps to Kubernetes and reduce the adminstrative effort of running your own cluster.  ACA is the fastest way to get started running apps on Kubernetes in Azure, with service mesh, ingress, and secure defaults. Generally, when a cloud provider bears more responsibility for a service, some features and capabilities are no longer available and ACA is no different. Kubernetes has many features that app owners either don't need, or don't want to maintain. This post reviews the advantages of ACA as well as some of the key features that aren't available to help determine if ACA is a good fit for your application.
