I built the first PC I ever used from some spare parts my dad had laying around. That was in 1989, I was 9 years old and instantly became a PC enthusiast. I had just built a system with a 286 CPU in an AT form factor tower case with a 20 Megabyte (not a typo) HDD and was already looking forward to upgrading to a 386. I built every PC I owned from then all the way until 2011 when I bought a laptop. There simply weren't any options for building a desktop class machine in a laptop form factor. Until now. [Framework](https://frame.work){rel="noopener"

## Consumer Electronics is broken

According to Framework, the consumer electronics industry is broken. The typical business model in the space promotes cranking out new devices every year that can be disposed of when the next model comes out. There's certainly a glut of "disposable" hardware out there, and that's the problem that Framework is trying to address by sustainably producing laptops that can easily be repaired and upgraded by the end user.  It's an ambitious goal, and as a natural skeptic myself I doubted they would get anywhere. 

However they have recently released the first upgrade, a user replaceable mainboard that fits in the same chassis which makes it possible to reuse most of the existing hardware while upgrading the core components like the CPU. After the upgrade, you don't just have to throw away the old board you can 3D print your own case and make a mini PC out of it. This is so similar to the experience I've had upgrading desktop machines over the years that I just had to try it out.
